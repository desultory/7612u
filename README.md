Linux Support for USB WiFi Adapters that are based on the MT7612U Chipset

USB WiFi adapters based on the mt7612u chipset have been supported in-kernel since
Linux kernel v4.19, therefore, there is no need to post a driver. This repo will
be used to provide information on useage.

The documents *Bridged_Wireless_Access_Point-1.md* and *Bridged_Wireless_Access_Point-2.md*
provide instructions for setting up an Access Point using a Raspberry Pi 4b with `hostapd`
and a USB WiFi adapter based on the mt7612u chipset.

The adapter used in the above documents is an [Alfa AWUS036ACM](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi).
This adapter works very well with the RasPi 4b.
